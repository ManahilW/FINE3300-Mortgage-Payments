The primary goal of designing this code is to help users understand the differences in payment frequencies for fixed-rate mortgages for a given principal amount, interest rate, and amortization period. This applies both to first-time home buyers and to those whose mortgages are up for renewal. The main users of this code are potential and current homeowners or financial planners.

This Mortgage Calculator program is implemented through a Python class named “Mortgage” which contains a function named “mortgage_payments”.  This function inputs three parameters, principal, rate and amortization, from the user. It then outputs a tuple of six payment frequencies to better help the user understand the various payment frequencies. These payments include the monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, weekly, rapid bi-weekly, and rapid weekly mortgage payments.

**Functionality Overview:**
1. The first step involves gathering the user’s inputs:
- Principal: The original total amount of the loan.
- Interest Rate: The annual interest rate, converted from a percentage to a decimal for calculation purposes.
- Amortization Period: The total period over which the loan amount is to be paid off, expressed in years.

2. The second step involves the conversion of annual interest rates to periodic rates:
- This conversion accounts for semi-annual compounding, which is a standard in Canadian financial contexts.
- Periodic rates are calculated separately for monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, and weekly payment plans.
- The formula used, *((1 + r / 2) ** (2 / n) - 1)*, adjusts the annual rate to reflect the compounding effect over the specified number of periods per year.

3. Next is the calculation of the present value annuity factor for each payment frequency:
- Utilizes the present value annuity formula: *(1 - (1 + r) ** -n) / r*
- This formula helps to determine the total amount payable per period by considering the time value of money.

4. Then determining the mortgage payments for each schedule:
- The payments for the monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, and weekly frequencies are calculated by dividing the principal by the corresponding annuity factor derived from the present value calculations.
- For the rapid bi-weekly payment, which is calculated by dividing the monthly mortgage payment in half. 
- The rapid weekly accelerated payments are calculated by dividing the monthly mortgage payment by four. 
- This results in the exact periodic payment amount required to fully amortize the mortgage over the specified period inputted by the user.

5. Lastly, formatting and output:
- The calculated payments are formatted to two decimal places for clarity and precision and are presented with the appropriate payment frequency.

The Mortgage class is designed to simulate real-world mortgage payment calculations that potential homeowners or financial planners might use to estimate periodic payments under different payment schedules.

For example, if the user were to input *a principal amount of $500,000, quoted at 5.5%, and
amortized over 25 years* the output would be as follows:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monthly Payment: $3051.96 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Semi-monthly Payment: $1524.25<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bi-weekly Payment: $1406.88<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weekly Payment: $703.07<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapid Bi-weekly Payment: $1525.98<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapid Weekly Payment: $762.99<br>
